The lawsuit alleges the advertising and labeling created a misleading impression about product quality, the\n      accuracy of listed ingredients, and claimed health benefits.

Which Products Are Eligible for a Payout? The settlement applies only to the following Balance of Nature products purchased in the United States during the\n      class period: • Balance of Nature Fruits capsules • Balance of Nature Veggies capsules • Balance of Nature Fiber & Spice powder Each individual bottle counts as one “unit” for purposes of calculating a settlement payment.

If you want $2 cash instead of the voucher, you must submit an Exchange Request on the settlement website or by mail to the settlement administrator.

Purchases for resale or other commercial purposes may not qualify. The settlement focuses on consumer\n            purchases for personal use in the United States. What Types of Items Included in the Settlement? The settlement applies broadly to bedding products, including but not limited to: • Bedsheets • Pillowcases • Sheet sets • Cooling sheet sets • More Sealy branded bedding advertised as 1250 thread count The key requirement is the 1250 thread count labeling, not the specific model name. Which Products are Not Included in the Open Class Action? • Products without 1250 thread count on the packaging • Products outside the purchase period • Non-Sealy branded bedding • Mattresses or other non textile bedding items If the packaging said 1250 thread count and carried the Sealy name, it may qualify regardless of retailer or\n            store. How Much Can I Get Paid? Settlement Class Members can receive $5 for each covered product purchased during the class period. • You can claim up to 8 products per household without providing proof of purchase, for a maximum of\n            $40 without documentation. • With proof of purchase, such as receipts or online order confirmations, you can claim an unlimited\n            number of eligible products at $5 each. Because the settlement fund is capped at $750,000, payments may be adjusted up or down on a pro rata basis\n            depending on the total number of valid claims approved and the amount left after attorneys fees, costs, and\n            administration expenses. How Do I File a Claim? To get a payment, you must submit a valid Claim Form by the deadline. There are two main ways to file. • File online at the official settlement website by completing the electronic Claim Form and certifying\n            the number of eligible Sealy 1250 thread count products you purchased. • File by mail by requesting or downloading a paper Claim Form and mailing the completed form to the\n            Settlement Administrator at the address listed in the official notice. If you wish to claim more than eight products, you will need to attach proof of purchase that shows you\n            bought additional covered Sealy 1250 thread count bedding during the class period. What is the Claim Form Deadline? The claim submission deadline is May 12, 2026. Online claims must be filed on or before that date. Paper\n            Claim Forms must be mailed and postmarked no later than May 12, 2026. What are the Important Dates? Here are the key dates listed in the settlement notice. • Exclusion request deadline: January 21, 2026 • Objection deadline: January 21, 2026 • Final Approval Hearing: February 11, 2026 • Claim Form deadline: May 12, 2026 Dates can change by order of the Court, so always confirm the most current dates and instructions on the\n            official settlement website before taking action. When is the Class Action Settlement Payment Date? There is no fixed payment date yet. The Court must first hold the Final Approval Hearing on February 11,\n            2026 and decide whether to grant final approval to the settlement. If the Court approves the settlement and\n            there are no appeals, payments will be made after the settlement becomes final and all claims have been\n            processed. If there are appeals, the process can take longer. The official settlement website will provide updates on\n            when payments are expected to go out once the settlement is finally approved. Is Proof Required to File a Claim? Proof is not required for smaller claims. You can receive up to $40 per household without proof of purchase\n            by claiming up to eight products at $5 each and certifying your purchases under penalty of perjury. If you want to claim more than eight products, you will need proof of purchase. Acceptable proof can include\n            receipts, order confirmations, or other documentation that reasonably shows you bought covered Sealy 1250\n            thread count bedding products during the class period. How Many People are Affected? The exact number of Settlement Class Members is not listed in the public notice. The settlement class\n            includes all consumers in the United States who bought covered Sealy 1250 thread count bedding products\n            between October 19, 2016 and October 30, 2025, so the number of affected purchasers is expected to be\n            significant. When Will this Class Action Be Certified? The Court has already preliminarily approved the settlement and authorized notice to the class. The\n            settlement class will be finally certified for settlement purposes if the Court grants final approval at the\n            hearing on February 11, 2026 and any appeals are resolved in favor of the settlement. What are the Odds this Class Action is Settled? The parties have already reached an agreement in principle and executed a settlement agreement, and the\n            Court has allowed the case to move forward through the notice and claims process. While there is no\n            guarantee until final approval and any appeals are complete, settlements at this stage are usually very\n            likely to be completed, provided the Court finds the terms fair, reasonable, and adequate. What is the Anticipated Settlement Amount? The anticipated settlement fund is $750,000. This amount will be used to pay notice and administration\n            costs, any Court approved attorneys fees and expenses, any service awards to the class representatives, and\n            then cash payments to Settlement Class Members who submit valid claims. How Much Will Each Class Action Claimant be Paid? Each valid claimant is expected to receive $5 per eligible product. • Up to 8 products per household (maximum $40) without proof of purchase • An unlimited number of products with proof of purchase at $5 each Because the settlement fund is limited, individual payments may be adjusted on a pro rata basis depending on\n            how many valid claims are filed and the net amount left in the fund after Court approved deductions. This\n            means your actual payment could be slightly higher or lower than the nominal $5 per product amount. How Do I Find Class Action Settlements?

You may be part of a new $87,500,000 class action settlement after allegations were raised that consumer\n            beef prices in stores were fixed. The antitrust class action lawsuit claimed that major American beef processors, including JBS, Cargill,\n            National Beef,\n            and Tyson Foods, conspired which each other to stop competing for market share, raising beef prices on\n            ordinary American consumers. The beef price-fixing class action lawsuit says that the purpose and effect of monopolizing and agreeing not\n            to compete for market prices was higher margins for the companies and higher prices paid by consumers for\n            beef. Tyson and Cargill deny wrongdoing. The Court has not ruled that the beef companies did anything wrong. The\n            settlements\n            are proposed and require final Court approval. Who is Included in the Settlement? You may be included and eligible for a payment if you indirectly purchased eligible beef products for\n            personal\n            consumption between August 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019. Indirectly purchased generally means you did not buy directly from one of the beef producers. Instead, like\n            99% of consumers, you bought it at\n            a grocery store or supermarket in your everyday food purchases. How Much Can I Get Paid? Your payment will be a pro rata share of the settlement fund and depends on how much eligible beef you\n            purchased during the class period and how many valid claims are approved. There is no fixed payout amount. If you bought more eligible beef than average, your payment may be higher.\n            If you bought less, your payment may be lower. Most everyday grocery shoppers should expect a modest payment, potentially ranging from a few dollars to\n            several dozen dollars, depending on total claims and Court approved deductions. Eligible Beef Products Eligible products include beef (fresh or frozen) made from chuck, loin, rib, or round primal cuts. Where You Must Have Purchased The class action states purchases must have been made in one of the listed states and jurisdictions,\n            sometimes referred\n            to as Repealer Jurisdictions: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan,\n            Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North\n            Dakota,\n            Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. What Beef Products Are Not Included? The class action settelment notice says these beef products are excluded if they were marketed as: • Premium: USDA Prime, organic, 100% grass-fed, Wagyu, American-Style Kobe Beef. • Specialty: No Antibiotics Ever (NAE), antibiotic-free, kosher, halal, certified humane. • Processed: Ground, marinated, seasoned, flavored, breaded, or cooked beef. How to File a Claim To receive a payment, you must submit a Claim Form with all required information by June 30, 2026. You can\n            file\n            online through the official settlement website or mail a claim form that is postmarked by the deadline. If you plan to file on behalf of someone else, the settlement administrator says documentation may be\n            required to\n            show you have authority to do so. Do I Need Proof to File a Claim? The beef class action lawsuit focuses on your estimated purchases during the class period. Many consumer\n            settlements accept claims\n            without receipts, but you should read the claim form instructions carefully and submit only truthful\n            information.\n            If you have documentation, you can keep it for your records in case the administrator requests follow-up. Estimated Payment If your claim is approved, payments will be a pro rata share of the net settlement fund after Court approved\n            deductions for administration, lawyer fees, costs, and any service awards. The notice says your payment is\n            expected to be proportional to the amount of eligible beef you purchased during the class period. The final\n            amount\n            depends on total valid claims.

If you owned a Rheem water heater, or owned a home or building where one was installed between 2019 and 2023, this settlement may apply to you. The class action lawsuit case involves claims that certain round plastic drain valves used in some Rheem water heaters could crack or fail, leading to leaks, water damage, or repair costs. Rheem has denied any wrongdoing, and the Court has not ruled on the claims. The settlement is proposed and will only take effect if it receives final court approval. What is the Total Settlement Amount? The settlement described in the notice is not a simple cash fund for all class members. Instead, it provides: • An automatic two year parts only warranty extension for the covered drain valve, without filing a claim, and • A claim process for reimbursement of documented losses up to $1,500 per class member, subject to settlement terms and an aggregate cap of $500,000 across all documented loss reimbursements, plus certain optional warranty or replacement benefits if you file a claim. How Do I Qualify For a Payout? You may qualify to request reimbursement if you are a class member and you have documented losses related to your use, installation, or ownership of the covered round poly drain valve. You are generally a class member if you own or previously owned: • A covered round poly drain valve, or • A home or other structure in the United States where a covered drain valve was installed. The class action lawsuit states the covered products include certain round poly drain valves manufactured and advertised between 2019 and 2023, identified by specific part numbers in the official notice. How Much Can I Get Paid? Eligible class members may request reimbursement for documented losses up to $1,500 per class member. Important limits mentioned in the notice include: • You must submit documentation such as dated receipts, invoices, technician reports, and or other records showing the amount incurred and the connection to the covered drain valve. • Documented loss reimbursement is subject to a total aggregate cap of $500,000 across all claims, and payments may be reduced proportionally if valid claims exceed that cap. How Do I File a Claim To request reimbursement for documented losses, and or to elect certain optional benefits, you must submit a claim by the deadline. According to the notice, you will typically need your contact information and the serial number of your Rheem water heater to complete the claim. You can submit a claim online through the official settlement website, or mail a paper claim form to the settlement administrator. What is the Claim Form Deadline? The claim deadline is March 20, 2026. Mailed claim forms must be postmarked by March 20, 2026. What are the Important Dates? • Claim Deadline: March 20, 2026 • Opt Out Deadline: February 20, 2026 • Objection Deadline: February 20, 2026 • Final Approval Hearing: May 11, 2026 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time (by Zoom) When is the class action settlement payment date? The notice does not provide a specific payment date. Settlement benefits, including any reimbursement payments, are expected to be provided after the Court approves the settlement and it becomes final. Appeals can delay timing. How long do Rheem water heaters usually last? :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} water heaters typically last between 8 and 12 years, depending on the model, water quality, maintenance, and usage. Some units may last longer with regular flushing and timely part replacements, while others may fail earlier due to corrosion, hard water, or component issues. What are common problems with Rheem water heaters? Common issues reported with Rheem water heaters include leaking drain valves, sediment buildup inside the tank, faulty heating elements, thermostat problems, and pressure relief valve failures. In some cases, plastic components like drain valves may crack or wear out over time, which can lead to leaks and water damage if not addressed. How popular is Rheem? Rheem is one of the most popular and widely used water heater brands in the United States. The company has been manufacturing water heaters for decades, and its products are sold through major home improvement stores, plumbing suppliers, and professional installers nationwide. Because Rheem water heaters are installed in millions of homes, issues involving Rheem products can affect a large number of homeowners. Is Proof Required to File a Claim? Yes for documented loss reimbursement. The notice states you must include documentation such as dated receipts, invoices, technician reports, and or other records showing both the amount and the connection to the covered drain valve. For optional warranty or replacement elections, the claim still requires specific information, and the notice states you will need the serial number of your Rheem water heater. What happens if I do nothing? If you do nothing, you will receive the two year parts only warranty extension for the covered drain valve, but you will not receive reimbursement for documented losses and you will give up the right to sue Defendants over the claims resolved by the settlement, if the settlement is approved. Optional Benefits You Can Elect If You File a Claim The class action settlement includes additional options that may be available if you submit a valid claim: • One Year Elective Parts and Labor Warranty Extension (limited to the first 100,000 valid claimants who elect it, according to the notice) • Replacement Brass Drain Valve (limited to the first 20,000 valid claimants who elect it, according to the notice) The settlement also states no labor is included with the replacement brass drain valve.

You may be part of a new $3,000,000 class action settlement reached with ZOA Energy over allegations that\n      certain ZOA Energy drinks labeled as having “0 Preservatives” were misleading because the products contain citric and\n      ascorbic acids. While ZOA Energy denies the allegations in the open class action lawsuit, saying its marketing and labeling were truthful and compliant, and the Court has not\n      ruled in favor of either side,  all parties agreed to settle to avoid the cost and risk of continued litigation. This does not mean ZOA Energy has admitted to any wrongdoing, but has accepted to pay consumers $3 million from this class action settlement to resolve the claims. What is ZOA Energy, and is it Related to The Rock? ZOA Energy is an energy drink brand famously co-founded by celebrity Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. The name “ ZOA ” has been explained as being rooted in the Polynesian word “toa,” meaning “warrior,” with the brand\n      adding letters to reflect energy “from A to Z.” The Rock is originally from Samoa, and has often highlighted his\n      Polynesian heritage publicly. How Do I Qualify For a Payout? You are included in the settlement if you are a resident of the United States who purchased any ZOA Energy drink\n      with a label stating “0 Preservatives” in the United States for personal consumption, not for resale or\n      distribution, between March 1, 2021 and November 21, 2025. How Much Can I Get Paid? The settlement is structured as $1 per unit purchased, with different caps depending on proof: Without Proof: Claims without receipts are capped at $10 per household. With Proof: Claims with receipts (or other accepted proof) are capped at $150 per household. If total approved claims exceed the available funds after court approved costs and fees, payments may be reduced\n      pro rata. Is Proof Required to File a Claim? No. You can file without receipts, but your payment is capped at $10 per household. If you submit receipts or\n      other accepted proof, your cap increases up to $150 per household. The notice states proof can include a receipt or purchase record, a removed UPC code, or other third party\n      documentation that reasonably shows the fact and date of purchase during the class period. How Do I File a Claim? Each household can submit one claim, either online through the official settlement site or by mail. Claims must\n      be submitted online or postmarked by February 20, 2026. What are the Important Dates? • Claim Form Deadline: February 20, 2026 • Opt Out Deadline: February 13, 2026 • Objection Deadline: February 13, 2026 • Final Approval Hearing: March 26, 2026 When is the Class Action Settlement Payment Date? A payment date is not listed as a single guaranteed day in the notice summary. In most cases, payments are\n      issued after final approval, and after any appeals are resolved, and after the claims administrator finishes\n      reviewing claims. How Many People are Affected? The class action does not yet provide a public estimate of how many people purchased the “0 Preservatives” labeled ZOA\n      products during the class period. The actual number of claimants will depend on how many valid claims are filed\n      by the deadline. When Will this Class Action Be Certified? The ZOA Energy open class action settlement is part of a proposed class action settlement process. The Court has preliminarily approved the\n      settlement for notice purposes, and it will decide whether to grant final approval at the March 26, 2026 hearing. What is the Anticipated Settlement Amount? The settlement fund is $3,000,000 total, which also covers attorneys’ fees and costs, notice and administration\n      costs, and the requested service award, subject to Court approval. How Much will Each Class Action Member be Paid? The maximum cap is $10 per household without receipts, or $150 per household with receipts or accepted proof, but\n      the final amount can be reduced if claims exceed the funds available for distribution.

The pork class action lawsuit claims that these companies violated federal antitrust laws and various state\n            antitrust, consumer protection, and unfair trade practices laws by restricting supply and coordinating price\n            increases. Pork Settlement in Brief ● The $7.39 million combined settlement consists of two agreements: $4.96 million from Seaboard\n                Foods and $2.429 million from Hormel Foods. ● No payments yet — funds will be held until other pork settlements are resolved. ● Claim Form period is not open yet; registration on PorkCommercialCase.com is recommended to get\n                notified. ● You should keep records of eligible pork purchases from June 28, 2014 - June 30, 2018 for when\n                claims open. ● The class action lawsuit Fairness Hearing for the Seaboard settlement was on December 10, 2025. ● Payout amounts will depend on the total number of valid claims and will be calculated after\n                attorney fees, costs, and expenses are deducted. What is the Total Settlement Amount? The total pork class action settlement amount includes $2,429,000 from Hormel Foods and $4,960,000 from\n            Seaboard Foods, totaling $7,389,000. How Do I Qualify For a Payout? To potentially qualify for a payout, you must be a commercial or institutional indirect purchaser who bought\n            uncooked pork bacon, fresh or frozen loins, shoulder, ribs, hams, or pork chops from defendants or\n            co-conspirators for commercial food preparation in qualifying locations from June 28, 2014 to June 30, 2018.\n            The qualifying states and territories may include: Arkansas, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts,\n            Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina,\n            North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia,\n            and Wisconsin.

What is the Update for the Pork Settlement? The $7.3 million pork settlement has received preliminary approval from the court. Seaboard's settlement was\n            granted preliminary approval and Hormel's settlement has also been preliminarily approved\n            as of August of 2025. This means the judge found both agreements fair enough to send notices to class\n            members and move the case forward toward a final approval (fairness) hearing. If the court grants final\n            approval, claimants will later be able to submit claim forms for payment.

A $78.5 Million Class Action Settlement has been reached with Toyota over allegations that the company designed and sold vehicles with defective and dangerous airbags. The problem was found in the Airbag Control Unit (Also known as the \"ACU\") component that is specifically responsible for airbags in case car accidents happen. Plaintiffs claim that the Airbag Control Unit in Toyota vehicles is susceptible to an electrical overstress situation, potentially leading to malfunctioning airbags and other safety systems during a collision. This could result in scenarios such as airbag non-deployment or other safety shortcomings. This resulted in Toyota being subjected to a class action lawsuit, which eventually resulted in a landmark settlement of $78,500,000. How Do I Know If I Qualify? The Settlement covers consumers who had vehicles listed below, which were sold or leased across the United States, including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all of the other U.S. territories. Toyota Model Model Year Toyota Corolla 2011 - 2019 Toyota Corolla Matrix 2011 - 2013 Toyota Avalon 2012 - 2018 Toyota Avalon HV 2013 - 2018 Toyota Tacoma 2012 - 2019 Toyota Tundra 2012 - 2017 Toyota Sequoia 2012 - 2017 If you are still not sure whether your vehicle is included in the Toyota Airbag Class Action Settlement you can use the settlement administrator's official VIN Lookup Tool to check whether you are eligible for a payout from the Toyota class action. To find your VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) you can typically  inspect either the driver's side dashboard or the driver's side door where you'll find the 17-digit VIN number for your vehicle and use it to check whether you can receive a cash payout or reimbursement. How Much Can I Get Paid? Consumers can qualify for a portion of the $78.5 Million Settlement fund. Toyota and the Court have agreed to numerous benefits for qualified Class Action members: • Reimbursement Out-Of-Pocket expenses related to recalls: This includes costs for transportation to and from a Toyota Dealer, such as rental car expenses if a loaner vehicle isn't provided, towing charges, childcare expenses incurred while waiting for the recall completion, unreimbursed repair costs for your vehicle's ACU, and lost wages due to time off from work for drop-off or pickup of your vehicle at a Toyota Dealer. • Potential Residual payments of up to $250: After all of the above out-of-pocket expense payments will be paid out, and if any money remains in the Settlement Fund, the remaining cash will be equally distributed between all qualifying Class Members. To receive reimbursement payment you must submit a valid claim form by the deadline. • A thorough vehicle inspection program: After the Court grants final approval for the Toyota Airbag Settlement, Toyota will start a program to inspect Subject Vehicles if the qualifying Toyota vehicle was in a frontal crash and Toyota was informed that the seat belt mechanism called the pretensioner and/or airbag didn't deploy. • An extended warranty for new parts is provided for vehicles that fall under the recall: Toyota will offer an Extended New Parts Warranty for all vehicles that complete the Recall. This warranty lasts for 12 years and covers any new parts installed as part of the Recall. It includes repairs or replacements for these parts, such as if the airbag warning light comes on due to a problem with the new parts or installation. • A program to inform members of the class about the recall: Toyota will start a program to reach out to owners of the affected vehicles included in the Recall. This program aims to increase the number of recalls completed by using different ways to contact owners and will adjust methods as necessary. • A program that may offer reimbursement for rental cars, provide loaner vehicles, and inform about any future Airbag Control Unit recalls: If a Class Member goes to a Toyota Dealer regarding the recall but does not receive a temporary loaner vehicle, they may be eligible to ask for reimbursement for reasonable rental car costs by submitting a Registration/Claim Form before the Claim Form deadline.

The open class action lawsuit alleges differences between Dollar General shelf prices and register prices, and claims the same procedures resulted in customers paying a higher price than advertised for the same and or similar merchandise in Dollar General stores. Dollar General has denied any wrongdoing. The Court has not ruled that Dollar General did anything wrong. The settlement is proposed and requires Court approval. What is the Total Settlement Amount?

The $5 Billion smartphone consumer antitrust case against Qualcomm is essentially over and closed. The trial judge entered a final\n            judgment in Qualcomm’s favor, and the consumers appealed to the the higher Courts. That\n            appeal has now finished, and the Court did not revive the claims. After receiving the appellate\n            mandate, the judge went back to the small remaining issue in the case, dismissed the last leftover claim,\n            and officially closed the case in April 2025. This means there is no active lawsuit, no certified class, and\n            no settlement for consumers. What was the Smartphone Class Action About? If you're one of over 300 million American consumers who use a smartphone you might be part of a pending smartphone open class action. The\n            class action was filed\n            against Qualcomm, an American processor chip manufacturer, which owns patents critical widely used\n            smartphone technology, such as 5G. It is unclear at this time whether the smartphone class action also includes smartwatches such as Apple watches, Samsung Galaxy\n                watches, Garmin watches, or Fitbits . Latest Update As of October 7, 2025 there is no settlement and no active claims process. The district court entered\n            judgment for Qualcomm on October 5, 2023. Plaintiffs appealed. On February 25, 2025, the Ninth Circuit\n            largely affirmed the district court’s dismissal and summary judgment rulings. On April 9, 2025, the\n            district court dismissed the remaining UCL unfairness claim. You can still register for case updates on\n            the official notice site here . Does This Include Android Phones? Yes. Many Android devices use Qualcomm chipsets, and those purchases could be part of the case if a class is\n            certified. This includes phones made by Samsung, LG, Motorola, and other manufacturers that relied on\n            Qualcomm’s technology. How Much Could Consumers Receive? No payout amount has been determined. Plaintiffs estimate that consumers collectively overpaid more than $5\n            billion for smartphones. If a settlement or judgment is reached, payments would depend on how many valid\n            claims are filed and the total settlement fund approved by the court. Can I Still Join the Smartphone Class Action? Yes. While there is no active claim form, consumers can register on the official case website to receive\n            future updates. Registration ensures you will be notified if a settlement or new claims process opens. Do I Need to Keep Old Phone Receipts or Serial Numbers? It’s a good idea to keep any proof of purchase, carrier bills, or device serial numbers for smartphones\n            bought after February 11, 2011. These records could help verify eligibility if a claims process becomes\n            available later. Is There a Deadline to Register for Updates? No specific deadline exists right now. Since the class is not certified and no claims are open, registration\n            remains available on the official notice site to ensure you receive future updates. Who Is Handling the Qualcomm Smartphone Lawsuit? The case is being managed by plaintiffs’ class counsel and is consolidated in the U.S. District Court for\n            the Northern District of California under Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley. The case name is In re Qualcomm\n                Antitrust Litigation , No. 3:17-md-02773-JSC. What Happens Next in the Qualcomm Case? The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld earlier dismissals, and the district court has since ruled\n            on remaining claims. Plaintiffs may pursue additional appeals or settlement negotiations. Consumers can\n            continue to register for updates as the legal process develops. What Is the Difference Between the FTC Qualcomm Case and This One? The FTC case was brought by the Federal Trade Commission over similar antitrust concerns but focused on\n            regulatory violations, not direct consumer damages. The current smartphone class action seeks monetary\n            compensation for consumers who allegedly overpaid for their devices. How Do I File a Claim? There is no claim form at this time. You can register to receive future notices and case updates from\n            the official notice website here . If a class is certified again or a settlement is announced later, the\n            notice site will provide instructions. Has the Smartphone Class Action Been Dismissed? Yes, the consumer Qualcomm smartphone class action has been dismissed for now. On February 25, 2025, the\n            Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals largely affirmed earlier rulings in favor of Qualcomm, which had dismissed\n            most of the plaintiffs’ claims. Then, on April 9, 2025, the district court dismissed the final remaining\n            “UCL unfairness” claim, closing the case at the trial level. There is currently no active class, no settlement, and no open claim process. Plaintiffs may still seek\n            further review or appeal, but as of now, the case remains dismissed. Consumers can continue to register on\n            the official notice site to receive updates if new proceedings or settlements are announced in the future. What Is the UCL Unfairness Claim? The “UCL” stands for California’s Unfair Competition Law. It allows consumers to challenge business\n            practices that are deceptive, unlawful, or unfair — even if they don’t break a specific federal law. In this\n            case, plaintiffs claimed that Qualcomm’s licensing and chip sales practices were “unfair” because they\n            allegedly inflated smartphone prices for consumers. The court ultimately dismissed the UCL unfairness claim in April 2025, finding that the plaintiffs did not\n            show enough evidence that Qualcomm’s conduct harmed consumers in a way that violated California’s\n            competition laws. Who would be included if a class is certified in the future? The most recent operative complaint focused on California consumers who purchased, paid for, or\n            reimbursed the price of UMTS, CDMA, or LTE smartphones for personal use on or after February 11, 2011.\n            The exact definition could change if a new class is certified by the court in the future. What products are potentially involved? Smartphones that used CDMA or LTE modem technology supplied under Qualcomm’s licensing practices. This\n            historically included phones sold by major brands. Accessories like smartwatches are not part of the\n            case based on current filings. Do I need proof of purchase? Not yet. Since there is no active claims process, save any records you have for phones you purchased\n            since February 11, 2011, such as receipts or carrier bills. If claims open later, guidance about\n            acceptable documentation will be provided on the notice site. When will payments happen? There is no payment timeline. Payments would only occur if plaintiffs obtain a judgment or a settlement\n            is reached and approved by the court. That has not happened. Where can I read the court decisions? You can read the Ninth Circuit's 2025 opinion here and view the federal docket history here . The official notice site also hosts filings and past notices here . Quick Takeaways • No settlement and no claim form at this time. • Register for updates on the official notice website here . • Keep purchase records for any smartphones bought since February 11, 2011 in case claims open in\n            the\n            future. The smartphone class action lawsuit was originally filed by the FTC where it claimed that Qualcomm\n            violated state antitrust laws in the United States, harming competition\n            and directly causing consumers to overpay for their cell phones for years, at least since 2011. The FTC\n            claimed that the amount consumers overpaid by more than $5 Billion as a result of Qualcomm's \"No\n            License, No Chips\" business practice. Qualcomm potentially engaged in anti-competitive conduct that raised the price consumers paid for\n            mobile phones. The cell phones involved in this litigation include phones with CDMA and\n            LTE technologies. This includes phones manufactured and sold by all of the top smartphone manufacturers\n            and companies such as Samsung ,\n            Apple, Huawei, LG, Motorola, and ZTE. Below is a list of the manufacturers involved in this class action\n            lawsuit. A full list of all smartphone models included in this class action can be found on the class\n            action administration claim form website (see at the bottom of this page).

Phones that were included as part of the purchase of a wireless network services contract are included\n            in this class action as well as single purchases. These contracts are typically offered from some of the\n            largest conglomerate wireless providers such as Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile,\n            or Sprint as part of marketing to get contract sign-ups.

Qualcomm's due process was ruled as having\n            been harmed due to the massive breadth and scope of the case involving almost every single cell phone\n            purchaser in the U.S. dating back more than a decade. As a result, the trial is currently pending in\n            lower courts. Amended Smartphone Class Action Complaint An amended class action complaint was filed on behalf of the proposed 250 million Americans affected by\n            the alleged price fixing of smartphones that contained Qualcomm processors. According to Reuters , the central thesis of the Qualcomm class\n            action lawsuit is that the company violated California state law, specifically anti-trust law called the\n            Cartwright Act. Previously, a third-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\n            overturned the certification of the Qualcomm class action. The argument made by Qualcomm's lawyers, among other arguments for the defense of Qualcomm, was that the\n            size of the class action settlement, 250 million class action members and an estimated $5 Billion in\n            funds, is too unwieldy. The size and scope of such a class action would make this one of the single\n            largest class action lawsuits in history. So What's Next For the Smartphone Class Action? The Qualcomm class action lawsuit has had its class action certification reversed by the U.S. Court of\n            Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and is currently pending a second amended class action lawsuit, which you can find here .

OpenClassActions.com is a participant in the Amazon affiliate advertising\n            program and this post may contain affiliate links, which means we may earn a commission or fees if you\n            make a purchase via those links. Is This Smartphone Class Action Legit or a Scam? Yes. The case is a real federal MDL in the Northern District of California. There is no payout right now.\n            Only register on the official notice website and avoid third-party forms that ask for sensitive data or\n            fees. Do Refurbished or Used Phones Qualify? If a future class is certified, eligibility may include refurbished or used devices purchased for personal\n            use during the class period. Keep proof of purchase showing model and date. Final rules would appear on the\n            official notice site. Do Carrier Installment Plans or Leases Count? Yes. Phones obtained through carrier financing, installment plans, leases, or upgrade programs could be\n            included if a class is certified. Keep carrier bills or finance agreements that show the device and purchase\n            date. What If I No Longer Have the Phone? You may still qualify if you can document the purchase during the class period. Save receipts, carrier\n            invoices, or account history that list the model and purchase date. What If My Employer Paid for My Phone? Business or employer-paid purchases are often treated differently from personal purchases. If the company\n            paid, the company could be the claimant. Keep records and watch the notice site for specific eligibility\n            instructions. Do Gifts or Hand-Me-Down Phones Qualify? Eligibility usually follows the purchaser who paid for the device. If you received a phone as a gift, the\n            person who purchased it may be the eligible claimant. Save purchase documentation if available. Can I Claim for Multiple Devices? Possibly. If a claims process opens, rules typically allow claims for each eligible device purchased during\n            the class period, subject to documentation and anti-fraud checks. Are Prepaid or Budget Phones Included? Many prepaid phones use Qualcomm chipsets. Inclusion would depend on the final class definition and proof\n            that the device falls within the covered technologies and dates. Do International Purchases Qualify? The consumer case focuses on U.S. purchases for personal use. Phones bought outside the United States are\n            usually excluded unless the notice says otherwise. What If I Returned or Traded In My Phone? Returns are usually not eligible. Trade-ins can still qualify for the original purchase if you can prove the\n            initial buy within the period. Keep both the purchase and trade-in paperwork. Does Switching Carriers Affect Eligibility? No. Eligibility is usually based on the device purchase, not which carrier you currently use. Keep the\n            original purchase or financing records. Will This Case Lower Smartphone Prices? There is no confirmed impact on pricing. If future relief changes licensing practices or results in monetary\n            relief, market effects would take time and are uncertain. Will I Owe Taxes on a Payment? Tax treatment depends on the nature of any payment. If a settlement is approved later, the notice will\n            include guidance. Consider speaking with a tax professional for personal advice. How Are Attorney’s Fees Handled? In class actions, attorney’s fees are typically paid from any settlement fund and must be approved by the\n            court. Consumers do not pay out of pocket to participate. How Long Should I Keep My Records? Keep receipts, carrier bills, or order confirmations for phones bought on or after February 11, 2011 until\n            the case fully resolves or a claims window closes. Can I Opt Out or Object? Those rights only apply if a settlement is proposed and approved for notice. If that happens, the official\n            notice will list deadlines and instructions to opt out or object. What Does Class Certification Mean? Class certification is when a court decides a case can proceed on behalf of a defined group of people with\n            common issues. The class here is not currently certified. What Is Summary Judgment? Summary judgment is a ruling made by the court without a trial when it finds no genuine dispute of material\n            fact on certain claims. Key rulings favored Qualcomm, which contributed to the case being dismissed at the\n            trial level. How Is This Different From Apple-Qualcomm Disputes? Apple and Qualcomm settled their separate corporate litigation in 2019. That settlement did not pay\n            consumers. The consumer case here seeks relief for people who allegedly overpaid for smartphones. How Do I Avoid Fake Claim Sites? Use the official notice website only. Do not share Social Security numbers or pay fees to file. Look for a\n            clear case name, court, and administrator contact on the official site.

This alleged conspiracy violated federal antitrust laws, specifically the Sherman Act, and resulted in consumers paying inflated prices for domestic air travel. Two airlines have already reached settlements while denying any wrongdoing. The total settlement is $60 million. Airline Class Action Update: The class action lawsuit against major U.S. airlines (see list below) is still ongoing. The class action court has denied motions for summary judgment from United and Delta, who are now seeking to appeal or have the original class action settlement decision reconsidered. American Airlines and Southwest have already settled for $45 million and $15 million respectively, but these funds are being held until the class action appeals conclude. • American Airlines, Inc. , • Delta Air Lines, Inc. , • Southwest Airlines Co. , • United Airlines, Inc. Settlement Funds from Other Airlines In the meantime, the settlement funds from the earlier settlements with American Airlines and Southwest Airlines are still being held in escrow (a special account). These settlement funds won't be distributed to class members until the class action lawsuit case against United and Delta is fully resolved, either through a settlement, a dismissal, or a final judgment at trial. Who is Excluded from the Airline Settlement? The court has also approved guidance from the class lawyers in the domestic airline class action litigation on who is excluded from the American Airlines and Southwest Airlines settlement classes. The exclusions don't just apply to the judges overseeing the case, but also to court staff, law clerks, and other court personnel involved in the litigation. This is because they are considered \"agents\" of the judges. The airlines class action lawsuit alleges that several large domestic airlines (American, United, Delta, and Southwest, US Airways and Continental Airlines), worked together to price-fix the cost of tickets. According to the class action lawsuit, airlines allegedly illegally agreed to set prices in order to increase fares by limiting capacity on domestic flights intentionally and maliciously, resulting in the artificial and agreed upon price gouging of their collective customers. The settlement is still being litigated for the rest of the airlines that have not yet contributed to the settlement funds in total of $60,000,000. Is the Domestic Airlines Class Action Settlement Delayed? At this time, the settlement funds received in the American Airlines and Southwest Airlines Settlements, less the Court-approved notice costs, remain in escrow. This is until the other two airlines, United and Delta either: settle, are dismissed, or receive a favorable judgment in which they will not have to contribute to the settlement fund on top of the already agreed-upon $60 million by Southwest and American Airlines. How Do I Qualify? The domestic airline settlement include any people or entities/business that meet the following requirements: • Those who purchased air passenger transportation services for flights, • Within the United States and its territories and the District of Columbia, • From Defendants or any predecessor, and any affiliates, including US Airways and Continental, • At any time between July 1, 2011 and June 14, 2018 How Much Can I Get Paid? The exact amount each eligible settlement class member will receive remains undetermined at this time. Given the potentially large number of class members, individual payouts may be modest. Additionally, the settlement administrators have indicated that it might not be economically practical to make direct cash distributions until additional settlements or judgments are achieved in the ongoing litigation against Delta and United Airlines. The amount ultimately received by each settlement class member may increase at the close of litigation against these remaining defendants. What are the Important Dates? Key dates related to this settlement include: • Class period: July 1, 2011, to June 14, 2018 (for the American Airlines settlement) • Class period for Southwest settlement: July 1, 2011, to December 20, 2017 • Southwest agreed to settle for $15 million in January 2018 • American Airlines reached a $45 million settlement in June 2018 • As of April 2025, the class action lawsuit against Delta and United Airlines is continuing, with these airlines recently being denied motions for summary judgment How Do I File a Claim? A notice about the claims process,\n            including the beginning and end of the claim period, will be made at a later date as ordered\n            by the Court. If you want to receive a notice about the claims process or future\n            settlements, you should submit your contact information on the Registration Form here . The Domestic Airlines Price-Fixing Class Action represents a significant development for consumers who purchased domestic airline tickets between 2011 and 2018. While two airlines have settled for a combined $60 million, litigation continues against Delta and United Airlines. No payments will be distributed until all cases are resolved, either through settlement or trial. If you believe you may be eligible for compensation, the most important step right now is to register on the official settlement website to ensure you receive updates when the claims process begins. The settlement administrators will provide detailed instructions for submitting claims at that time.

You may be part of a new $7 million class action settlement reached with La-Z-Boy and Stitch Industries (Joybird.com) over allegations that\n            La-Z-Boy deceptively advertised various\n            discounts for products sold on Joybird.com and in physical Joybird stores. The La-Z-Boy open class action lawsuit alleged is that certain Joybird discounts may have been misleading.\n            Plaintiffs claimed that some sale prices were advertised as limited-time or discounted from a higher\n            reference price when, according to the lawsuit, the products may have been sold at or near those prices\n            regularly. This is commonly called a deceptive pricing or false reference pricing claim. What matters legally is this: • The lawsuit alleged misleading discount advertising. • The companies deny the claims. • The case settled to avoid the cost and risk of litigation. • No judge ruled that the sales were fake or illegal. What is the Total Settlement Amount? The La-Z-Boy class action lawsuit estimates roughly $7,015,000 to\n            $7,150,000 in total value of $115 settlement benefits based on an estimated class size of about 61,000\n            people. Attorney fees (up to $1,325,000) and incentive awards (up to\n            $7,500 per class representative) are described separately and do not reduce the $115 benefits paid to class\n            members. How Do I Qualify For a Payout? You may qualify if you purchased one or more products at a sale price on Joybird.com or at a physical\n            Joybird store while you were in California, Oregon, or Washington, during the class period from December 18,\n            2019 to October 31, 2025. If you do nothing, you receive a $115 store credit voucher by default. If you want the $115 cash benefit,\n            you must submit a valid claim by the deadline and elect cash. How Much Can I Get Paid? The settlement benefit is $115.00 per settlement class member, either as cash (with a valid claim) or as\n            store credit by default. How Do I File a Claim To request the $115 cash benefit, submit the Claim Form on the official settlement website by February 13,\n            2026. The notice says a valid claim must match the email address or mailing address associated with one of your\n            Joybird purchases. You must also use the Claim ID, PIN, or Notice ID that was provided to you in the mailed\n            or emailed notice. If you did not receive a notice, you should contact the settlement administrator using\n            the number on the settlement website for help locating your claim credentials. What is the Claim Form Deadline? February 13, 2026. Who is Joybird and How Are They Related to La-Z-Boy? La-Z-Boy is a large, publicly traded American furniture company best known for recliners and upholstered\n            home furniture. Joybird.com is a modern furniture brand that sells customizable furniture online How they are related: La-Z-Boy announced in July 2018 that it would\n            acquire Joybird, and in La-Z-Boy's materials Joybird is treated as\n            part of its brand portfolio. That is why this class action settlement includes La-Z-Boy , Joybird, and Stitch Industries Inc. (the parent company of\n            Joybird.com) together. What are the Important Dates? • Claim deadline (for cash election): February 13, 2026 • Opt out deadline: February 13, 2026 • Objection deadline: February 13, 2026 • Final Approval Hearing: March 6, 2026 When is the class action settlement payment date? The notice does not list a fixed payment date. It states benefits will be distributed after final approval\n            and after any appeals are resolved. Is Proof Required to File a Claim? Yes. To get the $115 cash benefit, you must submit a claim and use the Claim ID, PIN, or Notice ID that was\n            sent to you, plus your purchase-linked email or mailing address. If you do not submit a valid claim by the\n            deadline, the notice says you will receive the $115 store credit voucher automatically instead. How Many People are Affected? The parties estimate approximately 61,000 settlement class members. When Will this Class Action Be Certified? The case is proceeding as a settlement class. The Court will decide whether to approve the settlement at the\n            Final Approval Hearing scheduled for March 6, 2026 (or on a new date if the hearing changes). What are the Odds This Class Action is Settled? A settlement has been reached and a court authorized notice has been issued, but it is still subject to\n            final Court approval and any appeals. If the settlement is finally approved and appeals are resolved,\n            benefits will be issued as described. What is the Anticipated Settlement Amount? The notice estimates roughly $7 million in total value of benefits, based on $115 per class member and the\n            estimated number of class members, plus separately requested attorneys’ fees and incentive awards subject to\n            Court approval. How much will Each Class Action Claimant be Paid? $115.00 per class member, either as cash (with a valid claim and required IDs) or as store credit by\n            default.

This settlement does not describe a cash fund for consumers. Instead, the settlement provides non cash\n            relief\n            in the form of a merchandise certificate worth up to $30. How Do I Qualify For a Payout? You may qualify if you reside in the United States and made one or more qualifying purchases at a Michael\n            Kors Outlet store between May 10, 2019 and November 14, 2025. The settlement creates two categories of eligible consumers: • California or Oregon KORSVIP Authorized Claimants, meaning KORSVIP account holders who have a\n            California or Oregon mailing address on file with Michael Kors and who made a qualifying purchase at a\n            California or Oregon Michael Kors Outlet store during the class period. • Nationwide Authorized Claimants, meaning other eligible purchasers who made a qualifying purchase\n            during the class period but do not meet the California or Oregon KORSVIP requirements above. How Much Can I Get Paid? Eligible class action members may receive one merchandise certificate that can be applied for up to $30\n            toward any\n            single in store purchase at a Michael Kors Outlet store. Important limits in the class action include: • One certificate per person. • Certificates are non transferable and cannot be combined with other certificates. • Certificates expire 90 days after issuance and have no residual value if you spend less than $30. • Certificates have no cash value and cannot be redeemed for cash. • Certificates cannot be used to purchase gift cards or gift certificates. How Do I File a Claim? If you do not have a California or Oregon mailing address on file with Michael Kors and you made one or more\n            qualifying purchases during the class period, you must submit a valid claim form to receive one merchandise\n            certificate. You can file a claim online through the official settlement website or download and mail a paper claim form. If you submit a claim, you will also give up your right to object to the settlement and you will not be able\n            to be part of any other lawsuit about the legal claims in this action. What is the Claim Form Deadline? The claim deadline is March 6, 2026. The settlement website states that online claims must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on March 6, 2026. Mailed claims must be postmarked by March 6, 2026. What are the Important Dates? • Claim Deadline: March 6, 2026 • Opt Out Deadline: March 6, 2026 • Objection Deadline: March 6, 2026 • Final Approval Hearing: March 27, 2026 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time When is the class action settlement payment date?

The class action does not mention any receipts are required to submit a claim. The settlement administrator\n            and Michael\n            Kors may verify claims, so you should submit only truthful information. When Will Claim Form Be Available? The claim form is already available on the official settlement website. When a Claim Form is Not Necessary A claim form is not necessary if you: • Received direct email notice of the settlement, • Are a KORSVIP\n            account holder with a California or Oregon mailing address on file, and • Made one or more qualifying\n            purchases at a California or Oregon Michael Kors Outlet store during the class period. If you do nothing and the Court approves the settlement, you will receive one (1) merchandise certificate in\n            the amount of $30.00. If you do nothing and receive the certificate, you will also give up your right to object to the settlement\n            and you will not be able to be part of any other lawsuit about the legal claims in this action. Does My Address Matter? Yes. Whether you need to file a claim depends on the mailing address Michael Kors has on file for you. If you do not have a California or Oregon mailing address on file with Michael Kors and you made one or more\n            qualifying purchases during the class period, you must submit a valid claim form to receive a merchandise\n            certificate. If you are a KORSVIP account holder with a California or Oregon mailing address on file and you received\n            direct email notice, you do not need to submit a claim. If you do nothing and the Court approves the\n            settlement, you will automatically receive one merchandise certificate. Your eligibility is based on the address on file with Michael Kors , not your current address and not the\n            address where the purchase was made. Case Overview The case is McCall et al., v. Michael Kors (USA), Inc., Case No. 25CU041352N, pending in the Superior Court\n            of\n            California, County of San Diego. The Court has preliminarily approved the settlement and will hold a fairness hearing on March 27, 2026 at\n            1:30 p.m. Pacific Time. The class action settlement notice lists the hearing location as the Superior Court of California, County of\n            San Diego, 325 S. Melrose Dr, Vista, CA 92081.

This settlement is against Stoneledge Furniture, LLC, not against Ashley Furniture or Ashley HomeStores,\n            although the class action lawsuit does involve pricing on Ashley's online furniture store. Stoneledge operated Ashley HomeStore-branded stores in California. The case was originally filed as Ryan\n            Cornateanu\n            v. Ashley Homestores, Ltd., then amended to name Stoneledge as the defendant in place of Ashley Homestores,\n            Ltd. The release language also references pricing and discount advertising involving Stoneledge or Ashley during\n            the\n            class period, including Ashley’s e-commerce website, but the defendant in this settlement is Stoneledge. What is the Total Settlement Amount? The Gross Settlement Amount is $750,000. Settlement payments are paid from the “net” settlement after\n            Court-approved deductions like settlement administration costs, attorneys’ fees and costs (as approved by\n            the\n            Court), and any Court-approved service award. How Do I Qualify For a Payout? You are included in the Settlement Class if you meet this definition: • You are in California, and • You purchased products from a Stoneledge store in California between March 9, 2017 and March 27,\n            2022, and • The “original price” or “regular price” was at least 10% greater than the “invoice price.” How Much Can I Get Paid? If your claim is approved, you can receive: • A pro rata cash payment (paid by check), and • A voucher good for $35.00 off a purchase at a Stoneledge-owned store. Your cash payment amount depends on how many valid claims are filed and the final “net” amount available\n            after\n            Court-approved deductions. How Do I File a Claim? You must submit a Claim Form online at the official settlement website or mail a paper Claim Form to the\n            settlement administrator. Claims filed by mail must be postmarked by the deadline and sent to: CORNATEANU v. STONELEDGE FURNITURE, LLC c/o Kroll Settlement Administration LLC PO Box 225391 New York, NY 10150-5391 What is the Claim Form Deadline? The Claim Form must be submitted online or postmarked by February 10, 2026. What are the Important Dates? • Claim submission deadline: February 10, 2026 • Opt out deadline: February 10, 2026 • Objection deadline: February 10, 2026 (see notice for filing requirements) • Final Approval Hearing: April 8, 2026 at 10:00 a.m. PST When is the class action settlement payment date? The notice describes payment by check for approved claims, but it does not list an exact payment mail date. In most settlements, payments are issued after the Court grants final approval and any appeal period ends.\n            If\n            there are appeals, payments can be delayed. Is Proof Required to File a Claim? The class action settlement is focused on eligibility criteria and submitting a valid and timely Claim Form. It does not say\n            that\n            receipts are required for every claim. However, the Claim Form does ask for a Claim ID, which may have been included in the\n            notice you received if you are already identified as a member of the Ashley pricing settlement class. If you did not receive your Claim ID, you can download the Claim Form from the settlement website and follow the instructions on the paper claim form. If you received a notice because records indicate you purchased, that may help. Still, always follow the\n            Claim\n            Form instructions and answer truthfully. The administrator may review claims for completeness and validity. How Many People are Affected? The notice states that records indicate certain people purchased qualifying products during the class\n            period, but\n            it does not provide a total number of affected customers or an estimated class size in the excerpt provided.

The class action settlement is\n            awaiting approval before a federal Court in San Francisco and will pay out an estimated $3,000 per covered\n            work to qualified claimants, subject to court-approved fees and costs. What is the Total Settlement Amount? The proposed class action settlement fund is $1.5 billion. How Do I Qualify For a Payout? You may qualify if you are a rights holder of a book that appears on the Works List tied to the case.\n            Plaintiffs have identified roughly 465,000 books so far that may be part of the lawsuit. How Much Can I Get Paid? Reports indicate an estimated payment of about $3,000 per covered work. Payments are subject to\n            court-approved fees and costs, and depend on how many rightsholders submit valid claims. Anthropic also\n            agreed to add $3,000 per work if the final Works List exceeds 500,000 titles. How Do I File a Claim? File a claim by the deadline of March 23, 2026. What are the Important Dates? • September 5, 2025: Preliminary approval requested of a $1.5 billion settlement in\n            the Northern District of California • March 23, 2026: Final claim form deadline. When is the class action settlement payment date? No payment date has been announced. Payments in class actions occur only after final approval and the\n            resolution of any appeals.

How to Claim Your Settlement Payment • Step 1: Check if Your Book is Eligible Verify your book appears on the Works List of approximately 465,000 titles. • Step 2: Gather Your Documentation Collect proof of your rights to the book: Copyright registration certificates Publishing agreements Rights assignment documents Other ownership proof • Step 3: Wait for Official Claim Portal The claim form is available until March 23, 2026. • Step 4: Submit Your Claim Complete the official form before the court-set deadline with all required documentation. • Step 5: Receive Payment Get approximately $3,000 per covered work after final approval and resolution of appeals. What did Anthropic allegedly do, and where did it get the books from? The class action lawsuit alleged Anthropic downloaded and stored copyrighted books from shadow libraries,\n            including Library Genesis and Pirate Library Mirror, then used those materials while developing AI systems.\n            Books3 is frequently reported as a separate dataset composed of pirated ebooks that appears in AI training\n            controversies. The proposed settlement requires destruction of downloaded infringing copies. Why the Anthropic AI Copyright Settlement Matters For authors and publishers, the proposal recognizes that unlicensed acquisition of creative works can\n            trigger substantial liability and meaningful compensation. For AI developers, it underscores the need for\n            clean data pipelines and licensing strategies. For courts and policymakers, it signals how copyright law is\n            being applied to modern AI systems. How Do I Find Class Action Settlements?
